# Cyber Security Live-Project

## Introduction to Live Project
For two weeks, I was part of a Cyber Security team working along side other team members from different departments. I joined the ongoing project and had multiple opportunities to test security measures and analyze malicious files. I utlized the OWASP Juice Shop web application to practice different injection techniques and finding security vulnerabilities. Along side that, I utilized Burp Suite to log into different accounts with credentials and bypass CAPTCHA requirements. I was also sent malicious email files and utilzied Wireshark to analyze them to see what viruses they contained. 


## OWASP Juice Shop App
Here is some of my work on the web application showing SQL injection, Null Byte Injection, Interception attacks, finding hidden files, and downloading the hidden file. These also include some incident reports I wrote.

This was a hidden file that would only open as a specific file. I used Null Byte Injection to open and download it:

This is where I used Burp Suite to bypass the CAPTCHA request:

## Wireshark
Here is some of my work analyzing the malicious files and some incident reports I wrote.

## Other Skills Learned
I learned many skills during this time frame:
* I learned how to communicate effectively and give approprite feedback. 
* I gained confidence in asking many questions to better understand the process and why the results occured. 
* When I felt stuck on a concept I did not know very well, I learned how to take effective breaks and then reached out if I needed help. 
* I also learned how to manage my time on each task so to make sure I was finished by the end of the two weeks.
* I gained "how to" research knowledge and learned how to navagate new topics with more confidence.
